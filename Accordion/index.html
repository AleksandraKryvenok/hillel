         Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
         documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
         by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
         languages such as JavaScript.

         Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
         describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
         such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
         alongside HTML and JavaScript.

         JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
         conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
         often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
         syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
         first-class functions.
